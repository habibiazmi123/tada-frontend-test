# Frontend Invoice for test at TADA

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Bonus: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be
used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
